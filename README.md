# üìÑ Meesho Helper - Complete PDF Processing Solution

Welcome to **Meesho Helper**! This is a comprehensive solution for Meesho sellers that includes both a web application and a native Android app. Efficiently manage and process your order labels and bills, streamline shipping tasks, and create personalized customer communications.

## üöÄ Available Platforms

### üåê Web Application
A powerful, user-friendly web interface accessible from any browser. Perfect for desktop and laptop users.

### üì± Android App
A complete native Android application that works offline. Ideal for mobile users who need processing capabilities on the go.

## ‚ú® What Does It Do?

This solution provides a seamless experience for transforming your raw Meesho order documents into actionable, print-ready files, available on both web and mobile platforms.

### Key Features:

Both platforms provide these core features:

1.  **Leaflet Generator:**
    * **Purpose:** Add a personal touch to every order.
    * **How it Works:** Upload your Meesho Order Label PDF, and the application will automatically extract customer names. It then generates a print-ready PDF containing personalized "Thank You" leaflets for each customer, perfect for including in your packages.

2.  **Bill Cropper/Combiner:**
    * **Purpose:** Efficiently prepare shipping labels from bulk orders.
    * **How it Works:** Upload your full multi-page Meesho Bill PDF. The utility intelligently crops each individual bill (removing unnecessary financial details and redundant address blocks) and then arranges 4 perfectly sized shipping labels onto a single A4 page, optimized for printing.

3.  **Hybrid Bill Generator:**
    * **Purpose:** A comprehensive, all-in-one printout for streamlined order processing.
    * **How it Works:** Upload your full multi-page Meesho Bill PDF. This advanced feature generates a unique A4 PDF page that combines both the cropped shipping labels and personalized thank-you messages. Each A4 page contains:
        * 4 precisely cropped shipping labels (arranged at the corners of the page).
        * 4 corresponding personalized "Thank You" leaflets, neatly placed in the large central space between the labels. This ensures you have both the label and a personalized note on one convenient sheet.
